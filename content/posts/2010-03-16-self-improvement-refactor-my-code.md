I don't know any young developper who wouldn't have liked a good review of its own code, but no-one could take the time to do so. Here comes <a href="http://refactormycode.com/" target="_blank">Refactor My Code</a>. The goal is simple : You post your code a you get a review.

Best way for a Java developper to understand the ways of Python, or a C++ one to understand Ruby.

Enjoy.
