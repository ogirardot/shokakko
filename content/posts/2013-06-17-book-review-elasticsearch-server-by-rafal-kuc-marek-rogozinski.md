  I'm not usually doing a lot of book reviews, mainly because i'm usually not finishing any book i begin...Â But i decided to finish this one, and i wanted to express my views on this book.Â If you look at the reviews of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1849518440/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1849518440&linkCode=as2&tag=rn0a4-20">ElasticSearch Server on amazon.com</a><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" style="border:none !important;margin:0!important;" alt="" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=rn0a4-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1849518440" width="1" height="1" border="0" /> you will get a first opinion that i can only agree with,Â <strong>this book is not for you, if you're looking for advanced tips and tweakings about ElasticSearch</strong>.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  It's mainly <strong>for begginners</strong> and it will get you through your first fears facing this versatile piece of technology, but if i were you i'd only consider this book when learning how to use elasticsearch if you have no prior experience with <a title="Apache Solr" href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/" target="_blank">Apache Solr or Lucene</a>.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  It does a good job introducing <strong>indexesÂ </strong>andÂ <strong>mappings</strong> and the fact that even if elasticsearch shields you from the old &#8220;Solr Â - schema.xml&#8221; by defining a default mapping for all newly created indexes and types (belonging to an index), this does not prevent you from needing to re-index all data when you realize the mapping you're using is not exactly... adequate.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  The main part of the book, at least the one i'd recommend, is not the part about <strong>Cluster AdministrationÂ </strong>or theÂ <strong>Getting startedÂ </strong>part, it's theÂ <strong>Searching your data </strong>chapter of the book. To me, this chapter is a reference part for all the <strong>query types </strong>Â supported by ElasticSearch and can be very useful when searching what kind of query you need.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  All in all it's not a bad book and you can keep it on the long term as a reference for theÂ <strong>query DSLÂ </strong>used by ElasticSearch through the HTTP/JSon API, but if you need something to guide you safely into production, you're better off experimenting by yourself.
