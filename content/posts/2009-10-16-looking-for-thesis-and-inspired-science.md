One of these days when i was trying to find out more about scientific issues for my projects, i came accross many websites trying to sell me thesis and published documents about what i needed to know. But one of the most exciting discovery that i made was of this website : <a title="CiteSeerX" href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/" target="_blank">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/</a>

This website is just like google books and it's a growing library of scientific publications and thesis, so if you need inspired thinking and get tired of Ted's, you should just check it out :

  <a rel="attachment wp-att-241" href="http://ogirardot.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/searchthesis.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-241" title="searchThesis" src="http://ogirardot.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/searchthesis.png" alt="searchThesis" width="409" height="382" /></a>This project is part of the <strong>Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting </strong>which is, in my view, one of the most useful project for science and computer technologies. Because it's always a first step toward knowledge and science to be able to share data and use them as we please (e.g. for Machine Learning or Collaborative Intelligence) : <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/openarchivesprotocol.htm" target="_blank">http://www.openarchives.org</a>. Enjoy !
