Finally it's done !! I've translated the final report we wrote, with Aude Quintana, on the OpenOffice.org project &#8220;The Eraser&#8221;.  
It was all about adding erasing features to OpenOffice Impress, and now, if you want, you can read how it went in english or french, here is the link for the pdf :
