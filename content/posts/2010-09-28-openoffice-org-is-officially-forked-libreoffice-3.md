  I honestly have been waiting for this since the first day i met with Thorsten Behrens and worked with him and Eric Bachard on improving OOo Impress.

  This is a great day ! That means that from now on, we can change anything in <a title="LibreOffice and the Document Foundation" href="http://www.documentfoundation.org/" target="_blank">LibreOffice</a>. And i can tell you that it wasn't the case under sun's reign. When Oracle took over Sun i hoped that it would change things with OOo, and in a way... it did.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  What i was afraid of, and still is, is about the name and credibility associated with OpenOffice.org. A lot of company and states switched over to OpenOffice.org after a long struggle to promote it as a great open source product.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  Now LibreOffice will have to struggle the same way. A positive note is that this fork already has the support of all Linux distributions and many OpenSource communities.

  I hope them the best and already donated in order for them to reach their financial objectives.

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  If you want to help and promote Libre Office, don't hesitate Donate for the <a title="Donate !" href="http://www.petitionspot.com/petitions/documentfoundation/donate" target="_blank">Document Foundation</a> and vote for them.
