Metasploit the famous exploit framework, allowing everyone to execute and study various exploits on any plateform is now rising to a more solid status. Originally the project was an OpenSource project made of many exploit developpers and friends contributing to build a strong and up-to-date exploit database. But the feature requests and bug fix requests were getting so frequent that a company got into this.

And now Metasploit is a product maintained by <a href="http://www.rapid7.com/" target="_blank">Rapid7</a> a security oriented company, and the lead developper of this software are now working for rapid7 24/7.

So i guess it will become an even more efficient tool, and you can read about the news by a contributor himself on this thread : <a href="http://seclists.org/metasploit/2009/q4/93" target="_blank">http://seclists.org/metasploit/2009/q4/93</a>
