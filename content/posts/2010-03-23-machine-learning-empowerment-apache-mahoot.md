Maybe we'll soon be able to get more out of machine learning algorithms, Google is communicating a lot, throught the _GSOC_ (Google Summer of Code) and Google Code as a whole, on this project and supporting the Apache foundation.
<!--more-->

&#8220;Mahout is an [Apache Software Foundation][1]{#n0af} project, which aims to create scalable machine-learning libraries using a variety of techniques including leveraging Apache [Hadoop][2]&#8221;

Let's see what get out of it, for now <a href="http://googland.blogspot.com/2010/03/g-training-toy-elephant-with-google.html" target="_blank">Apache Mahoo on Google Code</a> and on for the [Apache Project][3].

Enjoy.
