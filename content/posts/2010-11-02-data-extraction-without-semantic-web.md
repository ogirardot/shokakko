  Ok, now imagine you could extract any data from the web or any (un-)structured datasets... you got it ? okay now you certainly imagine it's just a dream, or a very expensive technology.

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  I thought just like you, until i came across this API : <a title="AlchemyAPI" href="http://www.alchemyapi.com/api/" target="_blank">http://www.alchemyapi.com/api/</a> with features like these :
</p>

  * Entity Extraction
  * Text Categorization
  * Language Detection
  * Concept Tagging
  * Keyword Extraction
  * Text Extraction
  * Content Scraping and Structured Data Extraction
  * Microformats Parsing/Extraction
  * RSS / ATOM detection

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  And the basic API is for FREE, and available with a SDK in many languages. I already tried the API in Python and it will clearly be useful to me, now or in the future. Check it out, and tell me what you think.
