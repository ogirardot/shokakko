In fact clob are designed to be large objects consisting of characters, so you might be surprise if you try once, with Java JDBC to insert into a database a String of more than 4000 chars... Because the system will crash without telling you any further explanation other than a SQLException.

And as a matter of fact 4k char is not exactly what anyone would call a &#8220;large object&#8221;, but the explanation is simple, if you try to insert a tuple into the database using a CLOB directly, if you didn't declare any particuliar behaviour, Oracle will try to store it INLINE (within the same segment) if its size is <4k otherwize the handling is external so you must initialize the tuple with the value EMPTY_CLOB().

The solution to this problem is therefor to do something like this :

<pre>// Insert once :
st.executeUpdate("insert into MY_TABLE values(" + id+ "',EMPTY_CLOB())");
// and update :
// using a prepare statement as usual
st.close();
</pre>

Enjoy !!
