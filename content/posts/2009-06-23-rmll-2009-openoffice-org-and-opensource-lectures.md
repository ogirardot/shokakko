After the work i've realised at the Ecole Centrale de Nantes with <a href="http://fredus85.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">FrÃ©dÃ©ric Gelot</a>, <a href="http://titaude30.eklablog.com/" target="_blank">Aude Quintana</a> and Pierre-Jean Parot, with the help of <a href="http://blog.thebehrens.net/" target="_blank">Thorsten Behrens</a> and <a href="http://eric.bachard.free.fr/" target="_blank">Eric Bachard</a> on OpenOffice.org, i'll be at the RMLL '09 (Rencontres Mondiales des Logiciels Libres)Â to present this work on OpenOffice Impress.

So if you're in Nantes and want to come and see me, please don't go to the lecture on Thursday 8th June between 10:50-11:10 called &#8220;Contribution Ã  OpenOffice.org de projets d'Ã©tudiants&#8221;... ðŸ™‚

See you there.
