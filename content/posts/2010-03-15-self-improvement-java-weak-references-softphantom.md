Adding to my series of article for self-improvement (especially) in Java, here's a <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/2006/05/04/understanding-weak-references" target="_blank">good link to explain Weak references</a> (vs Strong references). As usual it's open for comment the goal being to give anyone at least an idea of what it is and when it may be useful.

Enjoy.
